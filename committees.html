                    <h2>JCC - Joint Crisis Committee</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Joint Crisis Committee (JCC) is a type of Model United Nations (MUN) committee where delegates represent multiple countries or organizations in a crisis situation. In a JCC, participants must work together to address a rapidly developing global or regional crisis, such as a natural disaster, conflict, or political emergency. Unlike traditional MUN committees, which follow a structured debate format, the JCC focuses on fast-paced decision-making and problem-solving, often involving real-time updates and unexpected twists. Delegates are expected to think on their feet, adapt to changing situations, and collaborate with others to form solutions.
